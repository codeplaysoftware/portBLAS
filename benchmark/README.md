Benchmarks
===

## General information

The SYCL-BLAS benchmarks are intended to measure the evolution of the
performance of this BLAS implementation and how it compares with other tuned
implementations, such as [CLBLAST](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast)
(a very performant OpenCL BLAS library).

The benchmarks use Google's [benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
library and generate a report with indicative metrics (see instructions below).

## How to compile the benchmarks

The benchmarks are compiled with the project if the `BLAS_ENABLE_BENCHMARK`
CMake option is activated (which is the case by default).

The CLBLAST benchmarks are compiled only if CLBLAST is found, which requires
that:
* CLBLAST is installed (see
    [CLBlast: Building and installing](
    https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/blob/master/doc/installation.md))
* Either it is installed at the default location, or the CMake variable
    `CLBLAST_ROOT` indicates its location.

After the compilation, the binaries will be available:
* in the build folder, in `benchmark/syclblas/` and `benchmark/clblast/`
* if you provide an installation directory with the CMake variable
    `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, and run the installation command, e.g
    `ninja install`, in your installation folder, in `sycl_blas/bin/`

## How to run the benchmarks

The benchmarks take two kinds of command-line options: those for the benchmark
library and those specific to the SYCL-BLAS projects.

Essentially, the benchmarks can take a CSV configuration file (or will use
defaults), and if your machine has more than one OpenCL device, you can specify
which one to use. The other options specify how to output the results.

The most useful options for us are:

|option|parameter|description|
|------|:-------:|-----------|
| `--help` |   | Show help message |
| `--device` | device name | Select a device to run on (e.g `intel:gpu`) |
| `--csv-param` | file path | Path to a CSV file with the benchmark parameters |
| `--benchmark_format` | `console` / `json` / `csv` | Specify the format of the standard output |
| `--benchmark_out` | file path | Specify a file where to write the report |
| `--benchmark_out_format` | `console` / `json` / `csv` | Specify the format of the file output |
| `--benchmark_list_tests` | `true` / `false` | Display the names of all the registered benchmarks and abort (one line per tuple of parameters) |
| `--benchmark_filter` | regex | Run only the benchmark which name contains a substring that matches the given regex |
| `--benchmark_min_time` | min time | Override the minimum time that the library will run the benchmark for every tuple of parameters. Useful if the benchmarks take too long |
| `--v` | verbosity | Verbose level of the benchmark library |

You can check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/benchmark) of
the library for information about the other supported command-line arguments.

Here is an example of an invocation of the GEMM benchmark running on Intel GPU,
displaying the results in the console and saving a json report:

```bash
./bench_gemm --device intel:gpu --csv-param parameters.csv \
    --benchmark_out ../results.json --benchmark_out_format json \
    --benchmark_format console
```

### CSV format

The benchmarks can be given a CSV file containing the parameters to run with
(matrix/vector dimensions, transpose or not, etc), in the following format: one
line corresponds to one set of parameters, i.e one name for the library (though
it will be iterated many times for statistical accuracy).

The formats for the different BLAS levels are:

|blas level|format|description|
|:--------:|:----:|-----------|
| 1 | *size* | Vector size |
| 2 | *transpose_A,m,n* | Action on the matrix (`n`, `t`, `c`) and dimensions |
| 3 | *transpose_A,transpose_B,m,k,n* | Action on the matrices (`n`, `t`, `c`) and dimensions (A: mk, B:kn, C: mn) |

Here is an example of a valid CSV file for the GEMM benchmark:

```
n,n,42,42,42
n,t,64,128,64
t,n,13,3,7
```

### Python tool to generate a CSV file

If you don't yet have a file containing the parameters you want to run the
benchmarks with, we provide a Python generator in the script `gen_param.py`.
The script takes two command-line args:
* `-o` specifies the output CSV file
* `-e` specifies a generator expression in the DSL described below

The goal of the generator expression is to create an iterable where each element
is a tuple that will generate a line of the output file. This is achieved by
combining *ranges*, where ranges can be 1-dimensional (they generate one
parameter) or multidimensional (they generate a tuple).

Here are the bricks to build expressions with (you can find examples below):

|function|parameters|description|
|--------|----------|-----------|
| `size_range` | *low, high, mult* | Generates a 1-dimensional range from *low* to *high* with a multiplier *mult* |
| `value_range` | *val_1, ..., val_n* | Generates a range with exactly the given values |
| `concat_range` | *range_1, ..., range_n* | Generates a range with the union of all the values from all the given ranges |
| `nd_range` | *range_1, ..., range_n* | Generates a n-dimensional range by combining 1-dimensional ranges. It generates all the combinations so the cardinality of the resulting range can be really high |

#### Examples

A bunch of flat matrices:
```python
concat_range(nd_range(value_range(8), size_range(128, 512, 2)),
             nd_range(size_range(128, 512, 2), value_range(8)))
```
```
8,128
8,256
8,512
128,8
256,8
512,8
```

GEMV parameters:
```python
nd_range(value_range('n', 't'),
         concat_ranges(value_range(32, 64), value_range(1024)),
         size_range(128, 256, 2))
```
```
n,32,128
n,32,256
n,64,128
n,64,256
n,1024,128
n,1024,256
t,32,128
t,32,256
t,64,128
t,64,256
t,1024,128
t,1024,256
```

#### Some ranges to start with

The following ranges are a good starting point:

|blas level|range expression|
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | `nd_range(size_range(1024, 1048576, 2))` |
| 2 | `nd_range(value_range('n', 't'), size_range(128, 1024, 2), size_range(128, 1024, 2))` |
| 3 | `nd_range(value_range('n', 't'), value_range('n', 't'), size_range(128, 1024, 2), size_range(128, 1024, 2), size_range(128, 1024, 2))` |


### Default parameters

If no CSV file is provided, the default ranges will be used, as described below.
These ranges only use powers of two, and run all the possible combinations of
the values for all the parameters. This means that the BLAS 3 benchmark will be
run for 500 different parameter tuples by default.

If you need to use specific sizes or run less benchmarks, you can use the CSV
parameter files as described above.

#### BLAS 1

|parameter|values|
|---------|------|
| size | 4096, 8192, ..., 1048576 |

#### BLAS 2

|parameter|values|
|---------|------|
| transpose A | `"n"`, `"t"` |
| m | 64, 128, ..., 1024 |
| n | 64, 128, ..., 1024 |

#### BLAS 3

|parameter|values|
|---------|------|
| transpose A | `"n"`, `"t"` |
| transpose B | `"n"`, `"t"` |
| m | 64, 128, ..., 1024 |
| k | 64, 128, ..., 1024 |
| n | 64, 128, ..., 1024 |


## JSON output files

The benchmarks can create a report as a JSON file. This JSON file contains two
top level sections.

### Context

The `context` section is an object containing the following keys:
* `date`: when the benchmarks **start**. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`
* `host_name`: the value of `$HOSTNAME`
* `executable`: relative path to the exectuable from where it was invoked
* `num_cpus`, `mhz_per_cpu`, `cpu_scaling_enabled`, `caches`: information
     provided by the benchmark library. Not always relevant, especially if the
     CL device used is not the CPU.

### Benchmarks

The `benchmarks` section contains a list of objects corresponding to each tuple
of parameters the benchmark has been run with. Every object contains the
following keys:
* `name`: name of the benchmark and parameters, separated by slashes,
    e.g `BM_Gemm<float>/n/n/64/64/64`
* `iterations`: how many times the benchmark has been run
* `real_time`: total time between the start and end of the benchmark
* `cpu_time`: actual CPU time spent running the benchmark
* `time_unit`: unit used for these times. Should be `ns`, if not please file an
    issue.
* `avg_event_time`: the average of the CL/SYCL event times in nanoseconds. This
    time depends of the events returned by the BLAS functions used and might not
    be accurate in some cases
* `best_event_time`: the best of the CL/SYCL event times in nanoseconds. See
    warning above.
* `avg_overall_time`: the average wall time in nanoseconds.
* `best_overall_time`: the best wall time in nanoseconds.
* `total_event_time`: this is the event time of all iterations. Warning: the
    number of iterations is variable.
* `total_overall_time`: this is the wall time of all iterations. Warning: the
    number of iterations is variable.
* `n_fl_ops`: total number of floating-point operations. It is calculated
    theoretically based on the operations that we think the benchmark is doing.
* `bytes_processed`: total number of bytes read and written in memory. It is
    calculated theoretically based on the operations that we think the benchmark
    is doing.
* a few benchmark parameters (e.g `m`, `n`, `k` for GEMM)
* some other keys from the benchmark library
