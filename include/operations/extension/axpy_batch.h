/*!
 * This class holds the kernel implementation to perform axpy_batch
 * operator.
 *
 * It has three additional template parameters to keep the operation simple and
 * to avoid some computation or code divergence inside the kernel code.
 *
 * If sameSign is false the kernel always assumes that inc_r is negative. This
 * is true by construction. When the increases are of different sizes the result
 * positions are swapped and indexes must be computed accordingly. Keeping
 * always inc_r negative and inc_l positive reduces keep index
 * computation consistent, obtaining the correct result.
 *
 * sameSign indicate if inc_r and inc_l are of the sameSign. The code
 * implementation need to follow different index computation. This template
 * allow the condition at compile time, avoiding code divergency.
 *
 * localSize local size of group, allow some device tailoring at compile
 * time.
 *
 * maxBlockPerBatch set the number of device group to use for each
 * batch. If possible multiple batches are computed concurrently.
